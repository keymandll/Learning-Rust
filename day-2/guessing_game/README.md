# Guessing Game

Nothing serious here, I'm just learning Rust. This code is based on the Guessing Game in the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

## Distroless Docker Container

```
# Build the Docker image
$ docker build -t guessing_game .
# Start a container and play the game
$ docker run -ti guessing_game
```
